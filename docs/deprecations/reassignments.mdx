Step `out` methods does NOT accept `reassign` values anymore.

Starting from `v0.20`, Convenient Service can handle reassignments internally without the need of extra DSL.

The refactoring is straighforward:

### Before v0.20

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Service::Standard

  step OtherService,
    in: :item,
    out: reassign(:item)
end
```

### After v0.20

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Service::Standard

  step OtherService,
    in: :item,
    out: :item
end
```
