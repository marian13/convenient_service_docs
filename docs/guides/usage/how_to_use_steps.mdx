## Which types of steps are available?

The two criteria currently categorize steps.

- By action: service and method steps.

- By control flow: `and`, `or`, `not` steps.

## How to define a service step?

You can register existing services as steps of other services using the `step` directive.

Let's have a look at it in practice.

Having the `Service` service.

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

We can use it as a step of the `OtherService` service in the following way.

```ruby
class OtherService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step Service
end
```

This code works almost the same as:

```ruby
class OtherService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    Service.result
  end
end
```

That is why for a single-step service the usage of steps may not seem very beneficial.

So consider a more complex example.

Now we have 3 services.

```ruby
class FooService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

```ruby
class BarService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

```ruby
class BazService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

The `HostService` uses them as steps.

```ruby
class HostService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step FooService
  step BarService
  step BazService
end
```

Rough `HostService` equivalent without steps may be implemented as follows:

```ruby
class HostService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    foo_result = FooService.result

    return foo_result unless foo_result.success?

    bar_result = BarService.result

    return bar_result unless bar_result.success?

    BazService.result
  end
end
```

As you can see, steps allow us to eliminate at least 2 assignments and 2 if-conditionals for this particular example.

Sure, those assignments and if-conditionals are still performed under the hood, but it is no longer a developer's responsibility to manage them.

Now the benefit of steps becomes more obvious, but that is not the only benefit.

Other guides are going to demonstrate the additional simplifications.

## How to define a method step?

Any method can be a step.

The only requirement is that it must return a result.

For example:

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step :foo

  def foo
    success
  end
end
```

## What is the result of a service with steps?

Consider the following service.

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step :foo
  step :bar
  step :baz

  def foo
    success
  end

  def bar
    success
  end

  def baz
    success
  end
end
```

When all steps are successful, the overall service result is the last step result.

```ruby
result = Service.result
# => <Service::Result status: :success>
```

```ruby
result.step
# => <Service::Step method: :baz>
```

Let's check some other service.

```ruby
class OtherService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step :foo
  step :bar
  step :baz

  def foo
    success
  end

  def bar
    failure("Message from `bar`")
    # `error("Message from `bar`")` also stops the sequence.
  end

  def baz
    raise "Not raised exception"

    success
  end
end
```

When any step is NOT successful, the overall service result is that NOT successful step result.

```ruby
result = OtherService.result
# => <OtherService::Result status: :failure>
```

```ruby
result.step
# => <OtherService::Step method: :bar>
```

It is important to note that the remaining steps are NOT even evaluated.

That is why the exception from `baz` was not raised.

## What is an organizer?

*Organizer* is a service with steps.

It is also worth mentioning that services without steps are often referred to as *regular services*.

## How to pass arguments to steps?

Use the `in` option of the `step` directive.

Here is a quick example.

The `NestedService` accepts two keyword arguments - `:first_kwarg`, and `:second_kwarg`.

```ruby
class NestedService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  attr_reader :first_kwarg, :second_kwarg

  def initialize(:first_kwarg, :second_kwarg)
    @first_kwarg = first_kwarg
    @second_kwarg = second_kwarg
  end

  def result
    puts "first_kwarg: `#{first_kwarg}`"
    puts "second_kwarg: `#{second_kwarg}`"

    success
  end
end
```

This is how the `in` option is utilized in order to pass them as step inputs.

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step NestedService, in: [:first_kwarg, :second_kwarg]

  def first_kwarg
    :foo
  end

  def second_kwarg
    :bar
  end
end
```

As you can see below, the corresponding methods' return values are passed as `:first_kwarg` and `:second_kwarg` to the `NestedService` step when we call the organizer.

For this particular case, it is `:foo` and `:bar` respectively.

```ruby
result = Service.result
# "first_kwarg: `:foo`"
# "second_kwarg: `:bar`"
# => <Service::Result status: :success>
```

In order to simplify the understanding of the step inputs, let's have a closer look at this specific line.

```ruby
step NestedService, in: [:first_kwarg, :second_kwarg]
```

Whenever you have trouble with its meaning, please, remember that it can be [mentally translated](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table) like so:

```ruby
def first_step_result
  @first_step_result ||= NestedService.result(
    first_kwarg: first_kwarg,
    second_kwarg: second_kwarg
  )
end
```

That is why it is important to have corresponding instance methods defined for step inputs in the organizer class.

More examples of the `in` option usage may be found in [the so-called translation table](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table).

## How to access step result data?

Use the `out` option of the `step` directive.

Here is a short example.

The `NestedService` returns a `success` with data that has two keys - `:first_data_key`, and `:second_data_key`.

```ruby
class NestedService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success(first_data_key: :baz, second_data_key: :qux)
  end
end
```

This is how the `out` option is utilized in order to access them as step outputs.

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step NestedService, out: [:first_data_key, :second_data_key]

  step :result

  def result
    puts "first_data_key: `#{first_data_key}`"
    puts "second_data_key: `#{second_data_key}`"

    success
  end
end
```

Step result data values become available via the `first_data_key` and `second_data_key` instance methods.

For this particular case, they return `:baz` and `:qux`, the same values that were passed to the original `success` in the `NestedService` service.

```ruby
result = Service.result
# "first_data_key: `:baz`"
# "second_data_key: `:qux`"
# => <Service::Result status: :success>
```

In order to simplify the understanding of the step outputs, let's have a closer look at this specific line.

```ruby
step NestedService, out: [:first_data_key, :second_data_key]
```

Whenever you have trouble with its meaning, please, remember that it can be [mentally translated](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table) like so:

```ruby
def first_step_result
  @first_step_result ||= NestedService.result
end

def first_data_key
  first_step_result.data[:first_data_key]
end

def second_data_key
  first_step_result.data[:second_data_key]
end
```

Having this information, avoid defining instance methods with the same names as step outputs in the organizer class.

Otherwise, your methods will be silently overridden.

More examples of the `out` option usage may be found in [the so-called translation table](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table).

## How to create a step input alias?

There are cases when the organizer service does not have the corresponding method defined with the same name as a step input.

Or that method is already reserved for some other purpose and can not be reused.

Consider the example, when the `RemoveNilElements` service expects the `elements` keyword argument as its input.

```ruby
class RemoveNilElements
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  attr_reader :elements

  def initialize(elements:)
    @elements = elements
  end

  def result
    success(filtered_elements: elements.compact)
  end
end
```

The `PrepareCollection` service tries to register `RemoveNilElements` as its step.

```ruby
class PrepareCollection
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step RemoveNilElements, in: [:elements]

  def collection
    [42, nil, "foo"]
  end
end
```

Since it does not have the `elements` method defined, the usual `in: [:elements]` declaration won't work.

But it has the `collection` method instead.

In order to utilize its return value as the `:elements` input, the `PrepareCollection` should be updated as follows.

```ruby
class PrepareCollection
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  # highlight-start
  step RemoveNilElements, in: [{elements: :collection}]
  # highlight-end

  def collection
    [42, nil, "foo"]
  end
end
```

Now, the `in` option contains a hash `{elements: :collection}` that can be read as "Pass `elements` to step as `collection`".

:::tip

As a rule of thumb, try to memorize that the alias is always on the right side of the hash ðŸ˜Ž.

:::

Traditionally, to simplify the understanding of the steps-related stuff, input aliases this time, let's have a closer look at the `step` directive again.

```ruby
step RemoveNilElements, in: [{elements: :collection}]
```

Whenever you have trouble with its meaning, please, remember that it can be [mentally translated](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table) like so:

```ruby
def first_step_result
  @first_step_result ||= RemoveNilElements.result(elements: collection)
end
```

As you can see, creating an input alias is just passing a different method return value to the underlying service.

More examples of the `in` option aliases usage may be found in [the so-called translation table](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table).

## How to create a step output alias?

There are cases when the organizer service already has the corresponding method defined with the same name as a step output.

That method is probably reserved for some other purpose so it is not supposed to be redefined.

Consider the example, when the `RemoveNilElements` service returns the `filtered_elements` key as its output.

```ruby
class RemoveNilElements
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  attr_reader :elements

  def initialize(elements:)
    @elements = elements
  end

  def result
    success(filtered_elements: elements.compact)
  end
end
```

The `PrepareCollection` service tries to register `RemoveNilElements` as its step.

```ruby
class PrepareCollection
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step RemoveNilElements,
    in: [:elements],
    out: [:filtered_elements]

  def elements
    [42, nil, "foo"]
  end

  def filtered_elements
    elements - ["foo"]
  end
end
```

Since it already has the `filtered_elements` method defined, the usual `out: [:filtered_elements]` declaration overrides its return value.

Whenever you call `filtered_elements` before the `RemoveNilElements` step is executed, it returns `[42, nil]` (raises an exception for versions lower than v0.20).

But when you invoke it after the `RemoveNilElements` step is run, it returns `[42, "foo"]`.

Sometimes such behavior is expected, but typically we don't want to lose access to the original `filtered_elements` implementation.

That is why there is an ability to define output aliases.

Let's utilize one in the `PrepareCollection` service.

```ruby
class PrepareCollection
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  # highlight-start
  step RemoveNilElements,
    in: [:elements],
    out: [{:filtered_elements: :filtered_collection}]
  # highlight-end

  def elements
    [42, nil, "foo"]
  end

  def filtered_elements
    elements - ["foo"]
  end
end
```

The `out` option contains a hash `{:filtered_elements: :filtered_collection}` that can be read as "Retrieve `filtered_elements` from step as `filtered_collection`".

Now, the additional `filtered_collection` method is defined that is fully independent of `filtered_elements`.

:::tip

As a rule of thumb, try to memorize that the alias is always on the right side of the hash ðŸ˜Ž.

:::

As always, to simplify the understanding of the steps-related stuff, output aliases this time, let's have a closer look at the `step` directive.

```ruby
step RemoveNilElements,
  in: [:elements],
  out: [{:filtered_elements: :filtered_collection}]
```

Whenever you have trouble with its meaning, please, remember that it can be [mentally translated](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table) like so:

```ruby
def first_step_result
  @first_step_result ||= RemoveNilElements.result(elements: elements)
end

def filtered_collection
  @filtered_collection ||= first_step_result.data[:filtered_elements]
end
```

As you can see, creating an output alias is just retrieving a different key value from the underlying step result.

More examples of the `out` option aliases usage may be found in [the so-called translation table](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table).

## How to pass a dynamic value as a step input?

Let's consider the following service.

```ruby
class Service
  # ...

  step EscapeRegexp,
    in: [:pattern]
    out: [:escaped]

  # ...
end
```

We need to pass either `ENV["PATH_PATTERN"]` or `ENV["PATH_GLOB"]` to the `EscapeRegexp` step as the `pattern` argument.

As you may already guessed that is achievable by defining a corresponding instance method.

```ruby
class Service
  # ...

  step EscapeRegexp,
    in: [:pattern]
    out: [:escaped]

  # ...

  def pattern
    ENV["PATH_PATTERN"] || ENV["PATH_GLOB"]
  end
end
```

This is what you would usually do most of the time.

When the `pattern` method is reserved for some other purpose in your organizer service, there is always a possibility of using an alias.

```ruby
class Service
  # ...

  step EscapeRegexp,
    in: [{pattern: :template}]
    out: [:escaped]

  # ...

  def template
    ENV["PATH_PATTERN"] || ENV["PATH_GLOB"]
  end
end
```

In this example the `template` method return value is passed as the `pattern` argument.

But sometimes it may feel redundant or unnatural to define a dedicated method for such a simple task.

That is why there are two additional ways to dynamically pass a value as a step input:

- Using a `raw` step input argument.

- Using a `proc` step input argument.

## What is a `raw` step input argument?

Here is a quick example.

```ruby
step EscapeRegexp,
  in: [{pattern: raw(ENV["PATH_PATTERN"] || ENV["PATH_GLOB"]) }],
  out: [:escaped]
```

This is how the `step` call is "translated" to regular service invocation under the hood:

```ruby
def step_result
  @step_result ||= EscapeRegexp.result(pattern: ENV["PATH_PATTERN"] || ENV["PATH_GLOB"])
end
```

Since `raw` is just a [class method](https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubyref/language/methods-def.html#scope) you can pass to it anything from the enclosing class scope.

The value is forwarded without any intermediate processing.

```ruby
step EscapeRegexp,
  in: [{pattern: raw(any_class_method)}],
  out: [:escaped]
```

## What is a `proc` step input argument?

Here is a quick example.

```ruby
step EscapeRegexp,
  in: [{pattern: -> { ENV["PATH_PATTERN"] || ENV["PATH_GLOB"] }}],
  out: [:escaped]
```

Similarly to `raw`, the `proc` form also does not additionally process the passed value, but it is evaluated in the instance scope instead of the class scope.

So you can access any service instance methods in it.

```ruby
step EscapeRegexp,
  in: [{pattern: -> { any_instance_method }}],
  out: [:escaped]
```

## What is a `not_step`?

Once your codebase starts to grow, you will notice that it contains a lot of so-called boolean services.

The following list demonstrates some common names.

- `IsAdmin`.

- `HasAccessRights`

- `ShouldGrantPermission`.

- `AssertPolicySatisfied`.

- `EnsureEligibleForRemoval`.

- `ConfirmRuleApplied`.

- `WasPreviouslyChecked`.

- And so on...

Usually, such services are utilized as the precondition steps in organizers.

```ruby
class PlayAudio
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  # ...

  step AssertFormatSupported,
      in: :audio

  step EnsureDriverUpgraded,
      in: :format

  step ConfirmMaxSizeNotExceeded,
      in: :size

    # ...

  step :result

  def result
    # ...
  end
end
```

After a while it is just a matter of time when some of those preconditions are required to be used in some other contexts, but in the negated form.

In other words, negative counterparts are created.

- `IsAdmin` -> `IsNotAdmin`.

- `HasAccessRights` -> `DoesNotHaveAccessRights`.

- `ShouldGrantPermission` -> `ShouldNotGrantPermission`.

- `AssertPolicySatisfied` -> `RefutePolicySatisfied`.

- `EnsureEligibleForRemoval` -> `EnsureNotEligibleForRemoval`.

- `ConfirmRuleApplied` -> `DenyRuleApplied`.

- `WasPreviouslyChecked` -> `WasNotPreviouslyChecked`.

- And so on...

A majority of the time those services have very similar implementations.

The only difference is that `success` and `failure` results are switched.

For example, consider the `AssertFormatSupported` service.

```ruby
class AssertFormatSupported
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  attr_reader :audio

  def initialize(audio:)
    @audio = audio
  end

  def result
    return error("Audio is nil") if audio.nil?

    if !supported_formats.include?(audio.format)
      return failure("Audio `#{audio.name}` format `#{audio.format}` is NOT supported")
    end

    success
  end
end
```

Its opposite service `RefuteFormatSupported` has a slighlty distinctive definition.

```ruby
class RefuteFormatSupported
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  attr_reader :audio

  def initialize(audio:)
    @audio = audio
  end

  def result
    return error("Audio is nil") if audio.nil?

    if supported_formats.include?(audio.format)
      return failure("Audio `#{audio.name}` format `#{audio.format}` is supported")
    end

    success
  end
end
```

If you look precisely, only `!` and `NOT` are removed compared to the original `AssertFormatSupported` service.

As a consequence, it may seem not logical to maintain two almost identical solutions.

That is why the `not_step` directive is available.

It works similarly to the regular `step` directive.

It also has `in` and `out` options, supports `alias`, `raw`, and `proc` input arguments, etc, but it calls the `negated_result` under the hood.

Having that said, a `not_step` usage like in the following snippet:

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  not_step AssertFormatSupported,
    in: :audio

  # ...
end
```

Can be mentally translated to:

```ruby
def first_step_result
  @first_step_result ||= AssertFormatSupported.negated_result(audio: audio)
end
```

When the original `result` returns `success`, the `negated_result` returns `failure`.

When the original `result` returns `failure`, the `negated_result` returns `success`.

The `error` is always an `error`, so both the original `result` and `negated_result` return the same status.

Thus, the `not_step` directive (and `negated_result`) eliminates the need to maintain the opposite services when negated implementations are almost identical to the original.
