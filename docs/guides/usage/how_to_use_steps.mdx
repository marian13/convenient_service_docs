## Which types of steps are available?

The two criteria currently categorize steps.

- By action: service and method steps.

- By control flow: `and`, `or`, `not` steps.

## How to define a service step?

You can register existing services as steps of other services using the `step` directive.

Let's have a look at it in practice.

Having the `Service` service.

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

We can use it as a step of the `OtherService` service in the following way.

```ruby
class OtherService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step Service
end
```

This code works almost the same as:

```ruby
class OtherService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    Service.result
  end
end
```

That is why for a single-step service the usage of steps may not seem very beneficial.

So consider a more complex example.

Now we have 3 services.

```ruby
class FooService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

```ruby
class BarService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

```ruby
class BazService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

The `HostService` uses them as steps.

```ruby
class HostService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step FooService
  step BarService
  step BazService
end
```

Rough `HostService` equivalent without steps may be implemented as follows:

```ruby
class HostService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    foo_result = FooService.result

    return foo_result unless foo_result.success?

    bar_result = BarService.result

    return bar_result unless bar_result.success?

    BazService.result
  end
end
```

As you can see, steps allow us to eliminate at least 2 assignments and 2 if-conditionals for this particular example.

Sure, those assignments and if-conditionals are still performed under the hood, but it is no longer a developer's responsibility to manage them.

Now the benefit of steps becomes more obvious, but that is not the only benefit.

Other guides are going to demonstrate the additional simplifications.

## How to define a method step?

Any method can be a step.

The only requirement is that it must return a result.

For example:

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step :foo

  def foo
    success
  end
end
```

## What is the result of a service with steps?

Consider the following service.

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step :foo
  step :bar
  step :baz

  def foo
    success
  end

  def bar
    success
  end

  def baz
    success
  end
end
```

When all steps are successful, the overall service result is the last step result.

```ruby
result = Service.result
# => <Service::Result status: :success>
```

```ruby
result.step
# => <Service::Step method: :baz>
```

Let's check some other service.

```ruby
class OtherService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step :foo
  step :bar
  step :baz

  def foo
    success
  end

  def bar
    failure("Message from `bar`")
    # `error("Message from `bar`")` also stops the sequence.
  end

  def baz
    raise "Not raised exception"

    success
  end
end
```

When any step is NOT successful, the overall service result is that NOT successful step result.

```ruby
result = OtherService.result
# => <OtherService::Result status: :failure>
```

```ruby
result.step
# => <OtherService::Step method: :bar>
```

It is important to note that the remaining steps are NOT even evaluated.

That is why the exception from `baz` was not raised.

## What is an organizer?

*Organizer* is a service with steps.

It is also worth mentioning that services without steps are often referred to as *regular services*.

## How to pass arguments to steps?

Use the `in` option of the `step` directive.

Here is a quick example.

The `NestedService` accepts two keyword arguments - `:first_kwarg`, and `:second_kwarg`.

```ruby
class NestedService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  attr_reader :first_kwarg, :second_kwarg

  def initialize(:first_kwarg, :second_kwarg)
    @first_kwarg = first_kwarg
    @second_kwarg = second_kwarg
  end

  def result
    puts "first_kwarg: `#{first_kwarg}`"
    puts "second_kwarg: `#{second_kwarg}`"

    success
  end
end
```

This is how the `in` option is utilized in order to pass them as step inputs.

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step NestedService, in: [:first_kwarg, :second_kwarg]

  def first_kwarg
    :foo
  end

  def second_kwarg
    :bar
  end
end
```

As you can see below, the corresponding methods' return values are passed as `:first_kwarg` and `:second_kwarg` to the `NestedService` step when we call the organizer.

For this particular case, it is `:foo` and `:bar` respectively.

```ruby
result = Service.result
# "first_kwarg: `:foo`"
# "second_kwarg: `:bar`"
# => <Service::Result status: :success>
```

In order to simplify the understanding of the step inputs, let's have a closer look at this specific line.

```ruby
step NestedService, in: [:first_kwarg, :second_kwarg]
```

Whenever you have trouble with its meaning, please, remember that it can be always [mentally translated](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table) like so:

```ruby
def first_step_result
  @first_step_result ||= NestedService.result(
    first_kwarg: first_kwarg,
    second_kwarg: second_kwarg
  )
end
```

That is why it is important to have corresponding instance methods defined for step inputs in the organizer class.

More examples of the `in` option usage may be found in [the so-called translation table](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table).

## How to access step result data?

Use the `out` option of the `step` directive.

Here is a short example.

The `NestedService` returns a `success` with data that has two keys - `:first_data_key`, and `:second_data_key`.

```ruby
class NestedService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success(first_data_key: :baz, second_data_key: :qux)
  end
end
```

This is how the `out` option is utilized in order to access them as step outputs.

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step NestedService, out: [:first_data_key, :second_data_key]

  step :result

  def result
    puts "first_data_key: `#{first_data_key}`"
    puts "second_data_key: `#{second_data_key}`"

    success
  end
end
```

Step result data values become available via the `first_data_key` and `second_data_key` instance methods.

For this particular case, they return `:baz` and `:qux`, the same values that were passed to the original `success` in the `NestedService` service.

```ruby
result = Service.result
# "first_data_key: `:baz`"
# "second_data_key: `:qux`"
# => <Service::Result status: :success>
```

In order to simplify the understanding of the step outputs, let's have a closer look at this specific line.

```ruby
step NestedService, out: [:first_data_key, :second_data_key]
```

Whenever you have trouble with its meaning, please, remember that it can be always [mentally translated](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table) like so:

```ruby
def first_step_result
  @first_step_result ||= NestedService.result
end

def first_data_key
  first_step_result.data[:first_data_key]
end

def second_data_key
  first_step_result.data[:second_data_key]
end
```

Having this information, avoid defining instance methods with the same names as step outputs in the organizer class.

Otherwise, your methods will be silently overridden.

More examples of the `out` option usage may be found in [the so-called translation table](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table).

## How to create a step input alias?

There are cases when the organizer service does not have the corresponding method defined with the same name as a step input.

Or that method is already reserved for some other purpose and can not be reused.

Consider the example, when the `RemoveNilElements` service expects the `elements` keyword argument as its input.

```ruby
class RemoveNilElements
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  attr_reader :elements

  def initialize(elements:)
    @elements = elements
  end

  def result
    success(elements: elements.compact)
  end
end
```

The `PrepareCollection` service tries to register `RemoveNilElements` as its step.

```ruby
class PrepareCollection
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step RemoveNilElements, in: [:elements]

  def collection
    [42, nil, "foo"]
  end
end
```

Since it does not have the `elements` method defined, the usual `in: [:elements]` declaration won't work.

But it has the `collection` method instead.

In order to utilize its return value as the `:elements` input, the `PrepareCollection` should be updated as follows.

```ruby
class PrepareCollection
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  # highlight-start
  step RemoveNilElements, in: [{elements: :collection}]
  # highlight-end

  def collection
    [42, nil, "foo"]
  end
end
```

Now, the `in` option contains a hash `{elements: :collection}` that can be read as "Pass `elements` as `collection`".

:::tip

As a rule of thumb, try to memorize that the alias is always on the right side of the hash 😎.

Traditionally, to simplify the understanding of the steps-related stuff, input aliases at this particular time, let's have a closer look at the `step` directive again.

```ruby
step RemoveNilElements, in: [{elements: :collection}]
```

Whenever you have trouble with its meaning, please, remember that it can be always [mentally translated](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table) like so:

```ruby
def first_step_result
  @first_step_result ||= RemoveNilElements.result(elements: collection)
end
```

As you can see, creating an alias is just passing a different method return value to the underlying service.

More examples of the `in` option aliases usage may be found in [the so-called translation table](/basics/step_to_result_translation_table).
