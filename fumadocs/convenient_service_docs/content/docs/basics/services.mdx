## What is a service?

_Service_ is an object that does only one operation, [nothing more, nothing less](https://ludwig.guru/s/nothing+more+and+nothing+less).

Service may usually be implemented as follows:

```ruby
class Service
  def call
    # ...
  end
end
```

It has a single public method, often named [`call`](https://blog.eq8.eu/article/ruby-call-method.html) or `run`, `process`, `perform`, `execute`, etc, that is used to invoke its logic.

```ruby
service = Service.new

service.call
```

## Why do we need services?

Usual Ruby methods may solve similar problems as services most of the time.

Moreover, when it is possible to achieve the task only by using plain methods, it is almost always preferable.

As a result, services should NOT be considered competitors or replacements for methods, they are additions to them.

It is like a new option in the development toolbox.

You have primitives, methods, classes, etc, and now there is an ability to use a service.

For example, removing duplicates from an array can be implemented in multiple ways, you decide whether to utilize an [array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-duplicates-sorted-array/?ref=lbp), [hash](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-duplicates-from-unsorted-array-using-map-data-structure/?ref=lbp) or a [set](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-duplicates-from-unsorted-array-using-set-data-structure/), depending on your environment limitations.

The same case is with services. Just use them when you feel they bring advantages compared to other approaches.
